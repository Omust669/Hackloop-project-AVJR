<pre>Overview
This project is a solution designed to minimize the time customers spend waiting for their meals in restaurants, especially during busy hours. By enabling customers to pre-order their meals online, the website streamlines the dining experience, making it faster, more convenient, and hassle-free.

The idea was inspired by our own experience of delays in our college canteen, where heavy crowds often made it impossible to get food in a short break. With this platform, restaurants can serve their customers more efficiently, while customers can enjoy their meals on time.

Features
Online Pre-Ordering: Customers can browse the menu, select items, and place orders before arriving at the restaurant.
Customizable Menu: Restaurants can add, remove, or modify menu items as needed.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for both customers and restaurant staff.


How It Works:

For Customers:
Visit the website and browse the restaurant’s menu.
Add desired items to the cart .
Give your required information(name, email, phone number ,arrival/pickup time) and click on confirm order.
pickup/arrival time should be in between 9:00 AM to 10:00PM only.
Arrive to the restaurant at the said time.


For Restaurants:
Manage the menu via the admin panel.
