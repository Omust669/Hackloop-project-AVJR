<p>Overview<br>
This project is a solution designed to minimize the time customers spend waiting for their meals in restaurants, especially during busy hours. By enabling customers to pre-order their meals online, the website streamlines the dining experience, making it faster, more convenient, and hassle-free.<br>

<br>The idea was inspired by our own experience of delays in our college canteen, where heavy crowds often made it impossible to get food in a short break. With this platform, restaurants can serve their customers more efficiently, while customers can enjoy their meals on time.<br>

<br>Features<br>
Online Pre-Ordering: Customers can browse the menu, select items, and place orders before arriving at the restaurant.<br>
Customizable Menu: Restaurants can add, remove, or modify menu items as needed.<br>
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for both customers and restaurant staff.<br>


<br>How It Works:<br>

Give your required information(name, email, phone number ,arrival/pickup time) and click on confirm order.<br>
pickup/arrival time should be in between 9:00 AM to 10:00PM only.<br>
Arrive to the restaurant at the said time.<br>
